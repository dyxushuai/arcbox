//! TCP shim: hand-rolled handshake synthesizer + fast-path data plane.
//!
//! Replaces the smoltcp-based implementation entirely. The shim does the
//! minimum translation work a frame-to-socket bridge needs: generate our
//! own ISN, synthesize SYN-ACK / SYN / ACK frames for the 3-way, then
//! promote the connection to `FastPathConn` where host-socket bytes are
//! forwarded to/from the guest via TCP frames (or zero-copy inline via
//! the `arcbox-net-inject` thread when available).
//!
//! No congestion control, retransmission, reordering, or TIME_WAIT state
//! is implemented here — both endpoints (guest Linux kernel, host macOS
//! kernel) own their own TCP stacks end-to-end; any state machine work in
//! the middle would be duplication. Two sender-side disciplines make that
//! stance sound (2026-07-19, found by the network-workload e2e):
//!
//! - **Upload (guest→host)**: a segment is ACKed only for the bytes
//!   actually written, in order, to the host socket. Anything the socket
//!   didn't take (`WouldBlock`, short write) or that arrived beyond the
//!   contiguous cursor stays un-ACKed and the guest sees dup-ACKs — its
//!   own fast-retransmit/RTO machinery repairs the stream. ACKing past
//!   unwritten bytes is how uploads silently lost data.
//! - **Download (host→guest)**: the shim is the *sender-side* TCP for this
//!   direction, and the path beyond guest `eth0` (bridge → veth → container
//!   netns backlog) drops frames under burst like any real network — so it
//!   keeps the two sender duties a real stack cannot delegate: it never
//!   sends beyond the guest's advertised receive window (tracked from its
//!   ACKs, scaled by its SYN wscale, capped at [`HONORED_WINDOW_CAP`]),
//!   and it buffers in-flight bytes for retransmission (triple-dup-ACK
//!   fast retransmit, RTO backoff otherwise). Without these, one dropped
//!   frame wedged a flow forever and window overrun made that routine
//!   under concurrency.
